You have to understand binary numbers
to understand floating point numbers

Integers are never confusing. Infact for whole numbers
binary and decimal numbers

Never test whether floating point numbers are equal.
Instead define a function called close, that takes two floating points
and some epsilon and returns whether the absolute value of 
the difference of the floating poing numbers is less than epsilon

The goal in debugging is to move towards a bug-free program
A large part about learning to be a good programmer is learning
how to debug

Debugging is a learned skill. Don't despair

It is not hard to learn and it is largely a transferable skill

The first question you ask is why the program did what it did

Once you understnad this, you can easily fix the mishaps

Make sure you can reply things. So it may be wise to set a fix input and 
make sure the output doesnt change

Output may change because alot of programs use randomness
so you want to avoid that when debugging

Get in the habit of writing test harnes or test code

It has nothing to do with the program, but it helps test it
In industry almost half the code that gets written is test code

Remember to clone/copy instead of alias coz of how mutation works

When you alias, both variables reference thesame object, soa change
in one automatically changes the other one
