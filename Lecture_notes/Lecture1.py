Declarative vs imperative knowledge
Declarative says something that is true: a statement of fact
Imperative knowledge tells you how to solve a problem: think
of it as a recipe in a cookbook.


For example y is the squareroot of x if and 
only if y times y equals x.

We are not told how to find the squareoot, but how to check 
whether a number is the squareroot of another. 

Alot of computational techniques invlove guess and check
Where you generate guesses and check whether they are right

There are alot of problems we cannot solve precisely, but can find 
answers that a re good enough for practical purposes

When an algorithm halts, we say it has converged!

Ambiguous example: "I cannot praise this student too highly."

Programming language breakdown:
    Syntax
    Static semantic
    Semantic (when syntax and static semantic are well formed)
    
Python is easier to debug because it is an interpreted language, 
so the interperter can describe in the language of the source code 
what went wrong

Java on the other hand requires compilation, since source code is
first translated to object code , before the hardware knows how to 
interpret. Error message comes in terms of object code

Compiled languages are more efficient, and take less time to run.
